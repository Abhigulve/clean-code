<h1>Functions notes </h1>

<ul>
<li>Number of arguments to method max 2-3</li>
<li>If you pass variable and that been modified it's return type should be that variable type.</li>
<li>Method names should be self explinatory,longer names is not an issue.</li>

<li>In each method all methos calls should of same abstraction level.</li>

<li> Passing flags to method is terible practice.</li>
<li> assertEquals(expected,actual) here always struggle to to which one should be first.</li>
<li>When multiple arguments have to pass in single method args that means we can make object of it.</li>
<li>If your function must change state of somthing, have to be part of it.</li>
</ul>
